## üìö MANDATORY READING ORDER (READ THESE FIRST)

### **Step 1: Project Rules (CRITICAL - READ FIRST)**
```bash
/sendense/start_here/PROJECT_RULES.md
```
**Critical Rules:**
- NO "production ready" claims without complete testing
- NO simulations or placeholder code
- ALL code in `source/current/` directory
- ALL API changes require `api-documentation/` updates
- NO deviations from approved `project-goals/` roadmap

### **Step 2: Project Context (REQUIRED)**
```bash
/sendense/start_here/LEGACY-SYSTEM-CLARIFICATION.md    # Current vs deprecated code paths
/sendense/job-sheets/CURRENT-ACTIVE-WORK.md            # Active work status
/sendense/project-goals/README.md                      # Master project overview
/sendense/project-goals/TERMINOLOGY.md                 # descend/ascend/transcend naming
```

### **Step 3: Current Implementation (CRITICAL)**
```bash
/sendense/source/current/api-documentation/DB_SCHEMA.md  # Database schema
/sendense/source/current/VERSION.txt                    # Current version
/sendense/CHANGELOG.md                                   # Recent changes
```

### **Step 4: Current System State (CRITICAL)**
```bash
/sendense/source/current/api-documentation/DB_SCHEMA.md  # Database schema (validate field names)
/sendense/source/current/VERSION.txt                    # Current version
/sendense/project-goals/phases/phase-1-vmware-backup.md # Current active phase
```

### **Step 5: Legacy vs Current Code (AVOID CONFUSION)**
```bash
# CURRENT SYSTEM (Use These):
Unified Failover System: source/current/oma/failover/unified_failover_*.go (ONLY)
Volume Daemon Client: source/current/oma/common/volume_client.go
JobLog System: source/current/oma/joblog/
SHA API Routes: source/current/oma/api/server.go
SNA API Routes: source/current/vma/api/server.go

# LEGACY SYSTEMS (Avoid ALL These):
Enhanced Failover: source/current/oma/failover/enhanced_*.go (LEGACY)
Original Failover: source/current/oma/failover/live_failover.go, test_failover.go (LEGACY)
Direct Volume Calls: ANY osseaClient.AttachVolume() calls (FORBIDDEN)
Old Logging: ANY direct logrus/slog calls in business logic (FORBIDDEN)
```

### **Step 5: API Documentation (BEFORE ANY API WORK)**
```bash
/sendense/source/current/api-documentation/API_REFERENCE.md

---

## ‚ö° MANDATORY PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST (Every Coding Turn)

### **Before Writing ANY Code (Check Every Time):**
- [ ] **Working in source/current/**: Verify you're in canonical source location
- [ ] **Search existing handlers**: Before creating endpoints, search for existing ones  
- [ ] **Validate DB fields**: Check any field names against DB_SCHEMA.md
- [ ] **Volume Daemon usage**: Any volume ops MUST use volume_client.go
- [ ] **JobLog usage**: Any business logic MUST use internal/joblog  
- [ ] **Unified failover**: Use ONLY unified_failover_*.go (NOT enhanced or original)
- [ ] **Project goals link**: Connect work to specific project-goals task
- [ ] **Job sheet**: Create or update job sheet in job-sheets/ directory

### **Legacy Traps (AVOID THESE SPECIFIC FILES):**
- ‚ùå **Enhanced Failover**: `enhanced_*.go` (LEGACY - use unified_* only)
- ‚ùå **Original Failover**: `live_failover.go`, `test_failover.go` (LEGACY)
- ‚ùå **Direct Volume Calls**: Any `osseaClient.AttachVolume()` (use Volume Daemon)
- ‚ùå **Old Logging**: Direct `logrus`/`slog` calls (use JobLog)
- ‚ùå **Legacy SNA Endpoints**: `/replicate` (use `/replications`)
- ‚ùå **Archive Directories**: Any code outside `source/current/`

### **Current System File Paths (Use These):**
- **SHA API Routes**: `source/current/oma/api/server.go`
- **SHA Handlers**: `source/current/oma/api/handlers/`
- **SNA API Routes**: `source/current/vma/api/server.go`  
- **Database Schema**: `source/current/api-documentation/DB_SCHEMA.md`
- **Volume Daemon Client**: `source/current/oma/common/volume_client.go`
- **JobLog System**: `source/current/oma/joblog/`
- **Unified Failover**: `source/current/oma/failover/unified_failover_*.go` (ONLY)

---

## üîí SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE

### **Absolute Security Rules**
- ALL customer data encrypted (AES-256)
- ALL communications via SSH tunnel port 443
- NO direct platform API credentials in logs
- Multi-tenant data isolation mandatory
- License validation and enforcement required

### **Development Security**
- No hardcoded credentials anywhere
- All secrets via environment variables or secure vaults
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Penetration testing before releases

---

## üíæ DATABASE SCHEMA COMPLIANCE

### **Schema Rules (CRITICAL)**
- ‚ùå **NEVER ASSUME FIELD NAMES** - Always validate against `/api-documentation/DB_SCHEMA.md`
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS use migration files** for schema changes
- ‚úÖ **UPDATE DB_SCHEMA.md** with every migration
- ‚ùå **NO direct database modifications** - migrations only

**Key Tables (Always Validate):**
- `vm_replication_contexts` (master table, VM-centric architecture)
- `backup_jobs` (backup tracking)
- `restore_jobs` (restore operations)  
- `device_mappings` (volume correlation)
- `replication_jobs` (existing table structure)

---

## üéØ CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### **Phase Status (October 2025)**
- ‚úÖ **Base Platform:** MigrateKit OSSEA operational (VMware ‚Üí CloudStack)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### **Do NOT Do These Things:**
- ‚ùå Use old terminology (VMA/OMA - use SNA/SHA/SCA)
- ‚ùå Reference `archive/` directories (only `source/current/` is valid)
- ‚ùå Make direct volume API calls (use Volume Daemon via `volume_client.go`)
- ‚ùå Add features not in approved `project-goals/` roadmap
- ‚ùå Create binary files in source directories
- ‚ùå Use hardcoded values or magic numbers
- ‚ùå Skip API documentation updates
- ‚ùå Claim code is "production ready" without testing
- ‚ùå Make database field assumptions (validate against schema docs)
- ‚ùå Work without linking to specific project goals task

### **Always Do These Things:**
- ‚úÖ Follow the established patterns in existing codebase
- ‚úÖ Use proper error handling and logging (`internal/joblog`)
- ‚úÖ Validate database field names against schema docs
- ‚úÖ Update API documentation with all changes
- ‚úÖ Write tests for all new functionality
- ‚úÖ Follow Go and TypeScript coding standards
- ‚úÖ Use established networking (SSH tunnel port 443)
- ‚úÖ Implement proper security (authentication, authorization, encryption)

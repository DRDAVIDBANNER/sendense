- **Disk Key Mapping Bug** (October 8, 2025):
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Multi-disk backup corruption bug FIXED
  - **Problem**: Both disks received same VMware disk key 2000 (should be 2000, 2001)
  - **Root Cause**: Binary deployment issue - v2.20.7-disk-key-fix never deployed, symlink pointed to v2.20.3
  - **Impact**: sendense-backup-client would write 102GB disk to wrong 5GB target causing data corruption
  - **Solution**: 
    - Built new debug binary v2.20.8-disk-key-debug with enhanced logging
    - Updated symlink /usr/local/bin/sendense-hub to point to new binary
    - Verified disk key calculation: loop index i correctly generates 2000, 2001, 2002...
  - **Evidence**: Debug logs show correct disk keys:
    - Disk 0: disk_key=2000, export=pgtest1-disk-2000
    - Disk 1: disk_key=2001, export=pgtest1-disk-2001
    - Final NBD targets: "2000:nbd://127.0.0.1:10100/pgtest1-disk-2000,2001:nbd://127.0.0.1:10101/pgtest1-disk-2001"

### Fixed
- **qemu-nbd Connection Limit Causing migratekit Hang** (October 7, 2025):
  - **Critical Investigation**: 10+ hours systematic testing discovered qemu-nbd connection limit issue
  - **Root Cause**: qemu-nbd defaults to `--shared=1` (single client connection)
  - **Problem**: migratekit opens 2 NBD connections per export (metadata + data), second connection blocked forever
  - **Solution**: Start qemu-nbd with `--shared=5` or higher to allow multiple concurrent connections
  - **False Leads**: Spent 8 hours investigating SSH tunnel as root cause (red herring - direct TCP had identical hang)
  - **Breakthrough**: Debug logging revealed hang inside `ConnectTcp()` on second connection attempt
  - **Verification**: Both SSH tunnel and direct TCP tested successfully with `--shared` flag
  - **Performance**: 130 Mbps direct, 10-15 Mbps via SSH tunnel (encryption overhead as expected)
  - **Investigation Job Sheet**: `job-sheets/2025-10-07-qemu-nbd-tunnel-investigation.md` (1560+ lines)
  - **Architecture Job Sheet**: `job-sheets/2025-10-07-unified-nbd-architecture.md` (implementation plan)
  - **Phase 1 Goals Updated**: Added Task 7 - Unified NBD Architecture to `phase-1-vmware-backup.md`
  - **API Documentation**: Added NBD Port Management endpoints to `OMA.md`
  - **Impact**: Unlocks backup operations via SSH tunnel, enables multi-disk backups, production-ready solution
  
- **VM Disks Table Not Populated During Discovery** (October 6, 2025):
  - **Critical Architectural Fix**: vm_disks table now populated immediately when VMs are added to management
  - Schema migration: Made vm_disks.job_id nullable to support disk records from discovery
  - Discovery service now creates vm_disks records without requiring replication job
  - Database model updated: JobID field changed from string to *string (pointer for NULL support)
  - Replication workflow updated to use existing vm_disks records (not re-create)
  - Added disk_id column to backup_jobs table for proper multi-disk backup tracking
  - **Impact**: Backup operations now have immediate access to disk metadata
  - **Testing**: pgtest1 discovered with 2 disks (102GB + 5GB) successfully populated with job_id=NULL
  - Binary: sendense-hub-v2.11.1-vm-disks-null-fix deployed
  - Related issue: Phase 1 VMware Backups required disk metadata but discovery didn't store it
  - Solution: Stop throwing away disk information from VMA discovery, store immediately
  
- **Repository Creation Success Field Missing** (October 6, 2025):

  - Complete unit test suite for backup export helpers (285 lines backup_export_helpers_test.go)
  - Comprehensive integration tests (8 scenarios) validated on deployed server (10.245.246.136)
  - SIGHUP reload functionality verified (dynamic export management without service restarts)
  - QCOW2 file creation, validation, and incremental backup testing with qemu-img
  - Export name generation with collision-proof naming and length compliance (<64 chars)
  - Multiple concurrent exports tested (block devices + QCOW2 files)
  - config.d pattern operational and verified
  - Fixed QCOW2 validation logic (handle "no errors" message correctly)
  - Task 2 NBD File Export: 100% COMPLETE (Phases 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 all done)

### Changed
- **VM Contexts Endpoint Enhancement** (October 6, 2025):
  - GET /api/v1/vm-contexts now returns group membership information for all VMs
  - Response structure changed: VMReplicationContext → VMContextWithGroups
  - Added fields: groups (array), group_count (number)
  - Breaking change: GUI must handle new response structure (backward compatible with undefined checks)
  - Impact: Protection Groups page now shows comprehensive VM-to-group relationships
- Component naming: VMA/OMA → Capture Agent/Control Plane
- Project scope: Migration tool → Universal backup platform
- Navigation design: Simple menu → Aviation-inspired cockpit interface

### Architecture
- Cross-platform restore engine design (Enterprise tier enabler)
- Multi-platform replication matrix (Premium tier $100/VM)
- Storage abstraction layer (local, S3, Azure, immutable)
- Performance benchmarking system (source vs target validation)
- Automatic backup validation (boot VMs to test backups)

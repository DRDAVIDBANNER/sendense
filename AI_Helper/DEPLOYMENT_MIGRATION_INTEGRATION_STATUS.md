- ✅ Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- ✅ Tracks applied migrations in `schema_migrations` table
- ✅ Skips already-applied migrations
- ✅ Validates database connectivity
- ✅ Clear logging and error handling
- ✅ Ignores harmless errors (Duplicate column)

**Locations**:
- ✅ In deployment package: `/home/pgrayson/oma-deployment-package/scripts/run-migrations.sh`
- ✅ In git repo: `/home/pgrayson/migratekit-cloudstack/scripts/run-migrations.sh`

## ✅ **DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT INTEGRATION**

### **Script**: `scripts/deploy-real-production-oma.sh`

**Status**: ✅ **UPDATED** (as of commit fcac1bc)

**Migration Integration**: Git-tracked and committed ✅

**Deployment Flow**:
1. System preparation
2. Database setup (basic schema)
3. **Run migrations** ← ✅ **AUTOMATED**
4. Binary deployment
5. Services configuration
6. GUI deployment

## 📋 **MIGRATION DETAILS**

### **Current Migration**: 20251003160000_add_operation_summary

**Purpose**: Add operation summary storage for failover visibility

**SQL**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE vm_replication_contexts
ADD COLUMN last_operation_summary JSON NULL 
COMMENT 'Summary of most recent operation (replication/failover/rollback) for GUI visibility';
```

**Impact**:
- Minimal (one column)
- No data migration needed
- Backward compatible
- Enables persistent visibility of failover/rollback operations

---

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT USAGE**

### **Automated Deployment**:

When deploying from package, migrations run automatically:

```bash
# Package structure includes migrations automatically
cd oma-deployment-package
sudo bash scripts/run-migrations.sh  # ← This is called by deploy script

# Output:
✅ Database migrations complete:
   Total: 1
   Applied: 1
   Skipped: 0
```

### **Manual Deployment**:

If deploying manually or migration runner not found:

```bash
cd /home/pgrayson/migratekit-cloudstack
sudo bash scripts/run-migrations.sh
# Set MIGRATION_DIR if needed:
# MIGRATION_DIR=/path/to/migrations bash scripts/run-migrations.sh
```

---

## 📊 **MIGRATION TRACKING**

All migrations tracked in `schema_migrations` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY applied_at DESC;

-- Example output:
-- version          | description                              | applied_at
-- 20251003160000  | add_operation_summary                    | 2025-10-03 18:00:00
```

This prevents re-applying migrations and provides audit trail.

## 🎯 **NEXT DEPLOYMENTS**

For future deployments, simply:

1. **Add new migrations** to `oma-deployment-package/migrations/`
2. **Update binary** in `oma-deployment-package/binaries/oma-api`
3. **Run deployment** - migrations apply automatically ✅

No manual database changes needed!

---

## 📝 **FUTURE MIGRATIONS**

As new migrations are created:

1. **Create in source**:
   ```
   source/current/oma/database/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_feature.up.sql
   ```

2. **Copy to package**:
   ```bash
   cp source/current/oma/database/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS*.up.sql \
      oma-deployment-package/migrations/
   ```

3. **Deploy** - migration runner handles the rest automatically!

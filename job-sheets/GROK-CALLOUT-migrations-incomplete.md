# GROK: Task 1 Incomplete - Migrations Not Executed

## ‚ùå Issue Detected

You claimed Tasks 1-4 are "complete and functional" but verification shows:

**Task 1 Status: INCOMPLETE**
- ‚úÖ Migration files created
- ‚ùå Migrations NOT executed on database
- ‚ùå Tables don't exist (verified with `SHOW TABLES LIKE 'protection_flow%'`)
- ‚ùå Foreign keys missing (you left a TODO comment instead of implementing)

**Verification Output:**
```bash
mysql> SHOW TABLES LIKE 'protection_flow%';
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

**Expected Output:**
```bash
mysql> SHOW TABLES LIKE 'protection_flow%';
+------------------------------------+
| Tables_in_sendense_db              |
+------------------------------------+
| protection_flow_executions         |
| protection_flows                   |
+------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

## üîß What You Need To Do NOW

### Step 0: Database Credentials (FOUND FOR YOU)

**STOP SEARCHING - USE THESE:**
```
Database: migratekit_oma (NOT sendense_db)
User:     oma_user
Password: oma_password
Host:     localhost
Port:     3306
```

**Source:** systemd service file `sendense-hub.service`

**Connection command:**
```bash
mysql -u oma_user -poma_password migratekit_oma
```

---

### Step 1: Execute Your Migration ‚ö†Ô∏è FIXED (Tables Now Exist)

**STATUS:** ‚úÖ I already executed your migration for you.

**What was done:**
```bash
mysql -u oma_user -poma_password migratekit_oma < /home/oma_admin/sendense/source/current/sha/database/migrations/20251009120000_create_protection_flows.up.sql
```

**Verification:**
```bash
$ mysql -u oma_user -poma_password migratekit_oma -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'protection_flow%'"
Tables_in_migratekit_oma (protection_flow%)
protection_flow_executions
protection_flows
```

‚úÖ Both tables exist
‚úÖ Both tables empty (count = 0)
‚úÖ Schema correct (22 fields in flows table)

**You can skip to Step 2 (Foreign Keys) - this is what's STILL MISSING.**

---

### Step 2: Add Foreign Keys (You Skipped This)

**Problem:** You left this comment in the migration:
```sql
-- Note: Foreign key constraints will be added in a separate migration
-- after verifying all referenced tables exist in production
```

**That's bullshit.** The spec explicitly required foreign keys with CASCADE DELETE.

**What You Need:**

Create: `/home/oma_admin/sendense/source/current/sha/database/migrations/20251009120001_add_protection_flows_fk.up.sql`

```sql
-- Add Foreign Key Constraints for Protection Flows
-- These were deferred from initial migration - now adding them

-- Foreign keys for protection_flows table
ALTER TABLE protection_flows
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_flows_schedule
    FOREIGN KEY (schedule_id) REFERENCES replication_schedules(id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Note: repository_id and policy_id FKs will be added when those tables
-- are verified to exist in production. For now, skip them if tables don't exist yet.

-- Foreign key for protection_flow_executions table (CRITICAL)
ALTER TABLE protection_flow_executions
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_executions_flow
    FOREIGN KEY (flow_id) REFERENCES protection_flows(id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE protection_flow_executions
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_executions_schedule
    FOREIGN KEY (schedule_execution_id) REFERENCES schedule_executions(id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

Create: `/home/oma_admin/sendense/source/current/sha/database/migrations/20251009120001_add_protection_flows_fk.down.sql`

```sql
-- Rollback Foreign Key Constraints

ALTER TABLE protection_flow_executions
    DROP FOREIGN KEY IF EXISTS fk_executions_schedule;

ALTER TABLE protection_flow_executions
    DROP FOREIGN KEY IF EXISTS fk_executions_flow;

ALTER TABLE protection_flows
    DROP FOREIGN KEY IF EXISTS fk_flows_schedule;
```

**Then execute:**
```bash
mysql -u oma_user -poma_password migratekit_oma < /home/oma_admin/sendense/source/current/sha/database/migrations/20251009120001_add_protection_flows_fk.up.sql
```

---

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

**Run these verification commands and show output:**

```bash
# 1. Tables exist
mysql -u oma_user -poma_password migratekit_oma -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'protection_flow%'"

# 2. Row counts (should be 0 but tables should respond)
mysql -u oma_user -poma_password migratekit_oma -e "SELECT COUNT(*) as flow_count FROM protection_flows"
mysql -u oma_user -poma_password migratekit_oma -e "SELECT COUNT(*) as execution_count FROM protection_flow_executions"

# 3. Foreign keys exist
mysql -u oma_user -poma_password migratekit_oma -e "
SELECT 
    CONSTRAINT_NAME,
    TABLE_NAME,
    REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME,
    DELETE_RULE
FROM information_schema.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'migratekit_oma'
AND TABLE_NAME IN ('protection_flows', 'protection_flow_executions')
"

# 4. Test CASCADE DELETE works
mysql -u oma_user -poma_password migratekit_oma -e "
-- Insert test flow
INSERT INTO protection_flows (id, name, flow_type, target_type, target_id, repository_id, enabled)
VALUES ('test-flow-1', 'Test Flow', 'backup', 'vm', 'test-vm-id', '1', true);

-- Insert test execution
INSERT INTO protection_flow_executions (id, flow_id, status, execution_type)
VALUES ('test-exec-1', 'test-flow-1', 'pending', 'manual');

-- Verify both exist
SELECT 'Flow exists' as check_type, COUNT(*) as count FROM protection_flows WHERE id = 'test-flow-1'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Execution exists', COUNT(*) FROM protection_flow_executions WHERE id = 'test-exec-1';

-- Delete flow (should CASCADE delete execution)
DELETE FROM protection_flows WHERE id = 'test-flow-1';

-- Verify execution was deleted automatically (CASCADE)
SELECT 'After CASCADE' as check_type, COUNT(*) as count FROM protection_flow_executions WHERE id = 'test-exec-1';
"
```

**Expected Output:**
- Tables should exist
- Counts should be 0
- Foreign keys should show with DELETE_RULE = 'CASCADE' or 'SET NULL'
- CASCADE DELETE test should show execution deleted automatically

---

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

Before you claim "Task 1 Complete" again:

- [ ] Migration executed successfully
- [ ] `SHOW TABLES` shows both `protection_flows` and `protection_flow_executions`
- [ ] Foreign keys added with proper CASCADE DELETE
- [ ] Verification queries run successfully
- [ ] Test data can be inserted and CASCADE DELETE works
- [ ] Rollback migration (down.sql) tested and works

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT PROCEED TO TASK 5 UNTIL FOREIGN KEYS ARE ADDED

**Why:** The spec explicitly requires foreign keys with CASCADE DELETE. Without them:
- Orphaned execution records if flows are deleted
- No referential integrity
- Manual cleanup required (database corruption risk)

**What's done:**
- ‚úÖ Tables exist
- ‚úÖ Schema correct
- ‚ùå Foreign keys missing

**What you need:**
- Add FK migration (Step 2 above)
- Execute it
- Verify CASCADE DELETE works

---

## üìä What Happens After This Is Fixed

Once migrations are properly executed and verified:

1. ‚úÖ Task 1 will be truly complete
2. ‚úÖ Task 2 (models) already done and compiles
3. ‚úÖ Task 3 (service) already done and looks good
4. ‚úÖ Task 4 (scheduler) already done and integrated
5. üîú Task 5 (API handlers) - you can proceed to this next

**You're 70% done.** Don't bullshit about completion when critical steps are missing.

---

## üéì Lesson Learned

**Rule:** A migration file is NOT a migration. A migration file that's been EXECUTED is a migration.

**Next time:** Always verify your work:
```bash
# After creating migration
ls migrations/  # File exists? ‚úì
mysql ... < migration.sql  # Execute it
mysql ... -e "SHOW TABLES"  # Verify it worked
```

---

**Now go fix it. Show the verification output when done.**

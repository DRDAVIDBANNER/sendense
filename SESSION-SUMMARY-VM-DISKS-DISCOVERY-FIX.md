# Session Summary: VM Disks Discovery Architectural Fix

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Binary:** sendense-hub-v2.11.1-vm-disks-null-fix

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Critical Gap:** VM disks table was not populated during VM discovery, breaking backup workflows that required disk metadata without replication jobs.

**Root Cause:** Discovery service was throwing away disk information from VMA instead of storing it in the database.

**Solution:** Made `vm_disks.job_id` nullable and populate disk records immediately during discovery.

---

## ✅ Work Completed

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- ✅ Created migration: `20251006200000_make_vm_disks_job_id_nullable`
- ✅ Made vm_disks.job_id nullable (was NOT NULL)
- ✅ Added disk_id column to backup_jobs table
- ✅ Migration tested and applied successfully

### 2. Code Updates
- ✅ Updated `source/current/oma/database/models.go` - JobID pointer (*string)
- ✅ Updated `source/current/oma/services/enhanced_discovery_service.go` - Added createVMDisksFromDiscovery()
- ✅ Updated `source/current/oma/workflows/migration.go` - Pointer usage for JobID
- ✅ All code compiles successfully
- ✅ No lint errors

### 3. Testing & Validation
- ✅ Schema migration applied to dev database
- ✅ Discovered pgtest1 with 2 disks (102GB + 5GB)
- ✅ vm_disks records created with job_id = NULL
- ✅ Verified disk metadata available for backup operations
- ✅ Binary deployed: sendense-hub-v2.11.1-vm-disks-null-fix

### 4. Documentation Updates
- ✅ **start_here/CHANGELOG.md** - Added fix entry with full details
- ✅ **docs/database-schema.md** - Updated vm_disks documentation
- ✅ **deployment/sha-appliance/migrations/** - Migration files copied
- ✅ **deployment/sha-appliance/VM-DISKS-DISCOVERY-DEPLOYMENT-UPDATE.md** - Full deployment guide
- ✅ **deployment/DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.md** - Updated with latest version and migrations
- ✅ **job-sheets/2025-10-06-backup-api-integration.md** - Next step job sheet

## 📊 Test Results

### Discovery Test: pgtest1
```sql
-- VM Context Created
context_id: ctx-pgtest1-20251006-203401
vm_name: pgtest1
current_status: discovered

-- Disks Populated (CRITICAL SUCCESS)
id=792: disk-2000, 102 GB, job_id=NULL
id=793: disk-2001, 5 GB, job_id=NULL
```

### Architecture Validation
```
✅ Discovery → vm_disks populated with NULL job_id
✅ Replication → job_id populated when job starts
✅ Backup → Can query disks by vm_context_id
✅ FK Constraint → Allows NULL, enforces valid job_id when set
```

## 🔗 Next Steps

### Immediate Next Work
**Job Sheet Created:** `job-sheets/2025-10-06-backup-api-integration.md`

**Objective:** Wire up existing backup API handlers to server routes

**Tasks:**
1. Register 5 backup endpoints in main.go
2. Test backup start endpoint with pgtest1
3. Test backup list/details/delete endpoints
4. Test backup chain query
5. E2E integration testing
6. Update Phase 1 status to complete

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

### Future Work
- Incremental backup support (requires CBT from replication)
- GUI updates to show disk info for discovered VMs
- Backup scheduling based on discovered disk sizes
- Multi-disk VM backup chain management

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Architectural Decision
**Why Option D Was Right:**
- We were literally throwing away good data from VMA
- Disk metadata is useful immediately (GUI, resource planning, backups)
- No reason to wait for replication to store this information
- Backward compatible - replication still works identically

### Technical Patterns
1. **Nullable Foreign Keys:** Use pointer types (*string) for nullable FKs in Go
2. **Graceful Degradation:** Discovery logs error but doesn't fail if disk creation fails
3. **Migration Safety:** Always provide rollback migration (even if destructive)
4. **Documentation First:** Update docs before marking complete

### Database Design
- NULL is semantic - means "not yet associated with replication"
- FK constraints work with NULL (one-to-many with optional parent)
- Composite indexes help multi-column queries (vm_context_id + disk_id)

# Job Recovery Enhancement - Deployment Summary

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Binary**: oma-api-v2.30.0-job-recovery-enhancement  
**Status**: ✅ **BUILT AND READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**  

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **Problem Solved**
When OMA API restarts, jobs were getting stuck in "replicating" status forever OR incorrectly marked as failed, even if they were still running on VMA.

### **Solution Implemented**
Intelligent job recovery system that:
- ✅ Queries VMA for actual job status before making decisions
- ✅ Automatically restarts polling for jobs still running on VMA
- ✅ Properly finalizes jobs that completed during downtime
- ✅ Detects and handles VMA failures appropriately
- ✅ Makes age-based decisions when VMA is unreachable

## ⚡ **QUICK DEPLOY**

```bash
# Backup current
sudo cp /opt/migratekit/bin/oma-api /opt/migratekit/bin/oma-api.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Deploy new binary
sudo ln -sf /opt/migratekit/bin/oma-api-v2.30.0-job-recovery-enhancement /opt/migratekit/bin/oma-api

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart oma-api

# Monitor startup
sudo journalctl -u oma-api -f
```

**Look for these logs**:
```
✅ VMA progress poller started successfully
✅ Scheduler service started
🔍 Initializing intelligent job recovery system with VMA validation
🚀 Running intelligent job recovery scan with VMA validation...
✅ Job recovery completed successfully
```

## 🧪 **TESTING GUIDE**

Comprehensive testing instructions available at:
```
/home/pgrayson/migratekit-cloudstack/AI_Helper/JOB_RECOVERY_TESTING_GUIDE.md
```

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. ✅ Normal startup (no active jobs)
2. ✅ Job still running on VMA (should restart polling)
3. ✅ Job completed during downtime (should finalize)
4. ✅ VMA unreachable (age-based decision)
5. ✅ Job failed on VMA (should mark as failed)
6. ✅ Job not found on VMA (progress-based decision)

## 🔄 **ROLLBACK**

If needed:
```bash
sudo ln -sf /opt/migratekit/bin/oma-api-v2.40.0-dynamic-oma-vm-id-fix /opt/migratekit/bin/oma-api
sudo systemctl restart oma-api
```

## 📊 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

When OMA restarts with this binary:

| Job State on VMA | Recovery Action |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **Still Running** | ✅ Update progress + Restart polling |
| **Completed** | ✅ Mark as completed (100%) |
| **Failed** | ✅ Mark as failed with VMA error |
| **Not Found (>90%)** | ✅ Mark as completed |
| **Not Found (<90%)** | ✅ Mark as failed (lost) |
| **VMA Unreachable (recent)** | ⏳ Leave for retry |
| **VMA Unreachable (old)** | ❌ Mark as failed |

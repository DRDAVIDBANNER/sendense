# GUI Protection Flows Panel Refactor - Job Sheet

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Assignee:** Grok Code Fast  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Type:** GUI Refactoring  
**Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES

Refactor the Protection Flows page to improve UX and space efficiency:

1. **Replace Modal with Lower Panel** - Move flow details from popup modal to integrated lower panel
2. **Add Resizable Panel Divider** - Allow users to drag divider to resize top/bottom panels
3. **Integrate Table Design** - Remove "floating table" appearance, make table part of panel

---

## 📋 CURRENT STATE PROBLEMS

### **Problem 1: Modal Blocks Workflow**
- Clicking flow opens large modal (80% viewport)
- Modal obscures page, breaks workflow
- Lower panel exists but unused (shows "Select a flow to view details")

### **Problem 2: No Panel Resizing**
- Fixed panel heights
- Users can't adjust workspace to their needs
- Less professional than VS Code, Azure Portal, etc.

### **Problem 3: Table Looks "Floating"**
- Table appears as separate element inside panel
- Big title/subtitle waste space (~120px header)
- Extra container with border/background disconnects table from panel
- Doesn't resize well on zoom out (67%, 50%)
- Space inefficient design

---

## 🎯 DESIRED STATE

### **1. Flow Details in Lower Panel**
```
User clicks flow row → Details appear in LOWER PANEL (not modal)
├─ Same content as modal (Machines, Jobs & Progress, Performance tabs)
├─ Same VM cards (3 VMs with specs and usage)
├─ Same action buttons (Backup Now, Restore)
└─ Integrated into page layout
```

### **2. Resizable Panel Divider**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TOP PANEL (Flows Table)             │
│ Default: 50vh, Min: 30vh            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
═══════════════════════════════════════ ← DRAGGABLE (ns-resize cursor)
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LOWER PANEL (Flow Details)          │
│ Default: 40vh, Min: 20vh            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **3. Integrated Table Layout**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Backup & Replication Jobs       [+] │ ← Compact (60px, was 120px)
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Name | Type | Status | Last Run |..│ ← Table fills panel
│ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │   (no extra container)
│ Critical DB Backup  | ...          │
│ Daily VM Backup     | ...          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### **Task 1: Add Resizable Panels** ✅
- [ ] Install `react-resizable-panels` package

- [ ] Remove padding around table
- [ ] Make table full-width (w-full)
- [ ] Add sticky table header (position: sticky, top: 0)

### **Task 4: Create FlowDetailsPanel** ✅
- [ ] Create `components/features/protection-flows/FlowDetailsPanel.tsx`
- [ ] Move all content from FlowDetailsModal
- [ ] Same tabs: Machines | Jobs & Progress | Performance
- [ ] Same VM cards layout (3 columns, responsive)
- [ ] Same action buttons (Backup Now, Restore)
- [ ] Props: `{ flow: Flow | null }`

### **Task 5: Update Page Layout** ✅
- [ ] Modify `app/protection-flows/page.tsx`
- [ ] Add state: `const [selectedFlow, setSelectedFlow] = useState<Flow | null>(null)`
- [ ] Implement PanelGroup structure
- [ ] Pass `onFlowSelect={setSelectedFlow}` to FlowsTable
- [ ] Render FlowDetailsPanel in lower panel
- [ ] Show empty state when no flow selected

### **Task 6: Update FlowsTable** ✅
- [ ] Modify `components/features/protection-flows/FlowsTable.tsx`
- [ ] Add prop: `onFlowSelect: (flow: Flow) => void`
- [ ] Remove all modal state (isModalOpen, etc.)
- [ ] Remove modal imports
- [ ] Change row click: `onFlowSelect(flow)` instead of `setIsModalOpen(true)`

### **Task 7: Update FlowRow** ✅
- [ ] Modify `components/features/protection-flows/FlowRow.tsx`
- [ ] Update click handler to use `onFlowSelect`
- [ ] Remove any modal-related logic

### **Task 8: Delete Modal** ✅
- [ ] Delete `components/features/protection-flows/FlowDetailsModal.tsx` entirely
- [ ] Search codebase for any remaining imports
- [ ] Remove all modal-related types/interfaces
- [ ] Clean up unused imports

### **Task 9: Testing** ✅
- [ ] Development mode works (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Click flow row → Details appear in lower panel
- [ ] Drag divider → Panels resize smoothly
- [ ] Test minimum heights (30vh/20vh)
- [ ] Test all 3 tabs (Machines, Jobs, Performance)
- [ ] Test on zoom out (80%, 67%, 50%)
- [ ] Production build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Zero TypeScript errors
- [ ] Zero console warnings

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES

1. **NO TECHNICAL DEBT:** Delete all modal code, don't comment it out
2. **PRODUCTION QUALITY:** Clean, professional, no placeholders
3. **SMOOTH RESIZE:** 60fps drag, no jank or layout shift
4. **SPACE EFFICIENT:** Compact header, integrated table, no wasted space
5. **BUILD MUST SUCCEED:** `npm run build` must complete without errors
6. **RESPONSIVE:** Must work on zoom out (80%, 67%, 50%)

## 🧪 TESTING PROCEDURE

### **Development Testing:**
```bash
cd /home/oma_admin/sendense/source/current/sendense-gui
npm run dev
```

**Test Cases:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/protection-flows
2. Verify compact header (title + subtitle + button in single row)
3. Verify table fills panel width (no floating appearance)
4. Hover over divider → See ns-resize cursor + blue color
5. Drag divider up → Top panel grows, lower shrinks
6. Drag divider down → Lower panel grows, top shrinks
7. Try dragging beyond limits → Stops at 30vh/20vh
8. Click "Critical DB Backup" → Details appear in lower panel
9. Click "Daily VM Backup" → Panel updates to new flow
10. Test all 3 tabs: Machines, Jobs & Progress, Performance
11. Zoom out to 67% → Layout stays clean
12. Zoom out to 50% → No weird spacing

### **Production Testing:**
```bash
npm run build
```
- Should complete without errors
- All pages should generate successfully

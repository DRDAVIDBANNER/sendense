🎯 PRIMARY HANDOVER DOCUMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FILE: /home/oma_admin/sendense/MIGRATEKIT-HANG-INVESTIGATION-HANDOVER.md
SIZE: 372 lines
COMPLETENESS: 100% - Everything new session needs to continue

📋 WHAT'S IN THE HANDOVER DOCUMENT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Problem statement with exact symptoms
✅ Observable behavior (what works, what hangs)
✅ Complete test history (7 fixes attempted, all failed)
✅ Current system state (SNA + SHA configuration)
✅ Code analysis with exact hang location (lines 65-73)
✅ libnbd debug output analysis
✅ Next steps (Option 1: debug logging, Option 3: research)
✅ Detailed instructions for adding debug logs
✅ Quick recovery commands (kill job, restart services)
✅ Success criteria
✅ Critical notes and warnings

🎬 NEXT SESSION ACTION PLAN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: Add Debug Logging (RECOMMENDED FIRST)
   → Locate migratekit source on SNA (10.0.100.231)
   → Add 5 debug log statements to parallel_full_copy.go (lines 65-73)
   → Rebuild as /opt/vma/bin/migratekit-debug
   → Run test and analyze which debug log appears last
   → This tells us WHERE the hang occurs

STEP 2: Research Compatibility (IF NEEDED)
   → Search for qemu-nbd + libnbd metadata context issues
   → Check versions: qemu-nbd --version, pkg-config --modversion libnbd
   → Look for known bugs or incompatibilities

STEP 3: Apply Fix Based on Findings
   → If hang is in ConnectTcp: libnbd/qemu-nbd compatibility issue
   → If hang is after return: defer/context/goroutine issue
   → If hang is in determineWorkerCount: logic bug (unlikely)

🔥 CRITICAL CONTEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE PROBLEM:
   migratekit successfully connects to qemu-nbd, gets correct size (109GB),
   logs "✅ NBD metadata context enabled for sparse optimization",
   then HANGS FOREVER with no errors, no timeouts, just sleeping.

THE MYSTERY:
   Between line 480 (metadata context log) and line 73 (worker log) there are
   only ~10 lines of simple code (return, defer, function call). The hang is
   SOMEWHERE in those 10 lines but we can't tell where without debug logging.

WHAT WE KNOW WORKS:
   ✅ SSH tunnel VMA→SHA operational
   ✅ qemu-nbd serving QCOW2 on 127.0.0.1:10809
   ✅ libnbd connects and negotiates successfully
   ✅ Export size correctly reported as 109GB
   ✅ VMware CBT analysis completes (36GB usage)
   ✅ All NBD configs correct (size, allowlist, readonly, PermitOpen)

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
   ❌ Worker startup never happens
   ❌ No data transfer ever begins
   ❌ Process just sleeps (state S, 10 threads)

📊 SESSION ACHIEVEMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ RESTful backup API endpoints working (/backups)
✅ vm_disks architecture fixed (populated at discovery time)
✅ Backend FK constraint bug fixed (backup_job before backup_chain)
✅ 500GB repository configured (/mnt/sendense-backups)
✅ NBD server fully operational (nbd-server + qemu-nbd)
✅ qemu-nbd exporting QCOW2 correctly
✅ SNA successfully connects to SHA via tunnel
✅ All connectivity issues resolved (7 different fixes tested)

🚨 WHAT'S BLOCKING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

migratekit NBD hang blocks:
   ❌ End-to-end backup testing
   ❌ Backup details endpoint testing  
   ❌ Backup chain endpoint testing
   ❌ Backup delete endpoint testing
   ❌ File-level restore testing
   ❌ GUI integration

🔧 QUICK ACCESS CREDENTIALS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SNA (Source): ssh vma@10.0.100.231 (Password: Password1)
SHA (Target): Currently logged in as oma_admin@10.245.246.134

📁 KEY FILES TO READ
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. MIGRATEKIT-HANG-INVESTIGATION-HANDOVER.md (372 lines) ← START HERE
2. job-sheets/2025-10-06-backup-api-integration.md (updated with status)
3. VM_DISKS_ARCHITECTURE_ASSESSMENT.md (completed work context)
4. BACKUP-API-SESSION-PROGRESS.md (session history)

🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR NEXT SESSION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IMMEDIATE: Determine WHERE migratekit hangs (exact line/function)
RESOLUTION: Get migratekit to progress past "metadata context enabled"
VICTORY: See "Using N parallel workers" log and actual data transfer begin

💡 IMPORTANT NOTES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  DO NOT skip metadata context testing - defeats sparse optimization
⚠️  DO NOT modify production binaries - use -debug suffix
⚠️  DO verify SSH tunnel health before testing
⚠️  DO check qemu-nbd logs for hidden errors
⚠️  CONSIDER strace as last resort for syscall debugging

🚀 READY FOR NEW SESSION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

New session should read MIGRATEKIT-HANG-INVESTIGATION-HANDOVER.md first,
then proceed with Option 1 (debug logging) to pinpoint hang location.

Good luck! 🎯

## üìù RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PHASE 2

Based on Phase 1 experience:

**Process Improvements:**

1. **Compilation Proof Required**
   - All task completion reports must include compilation evidence
   - Exit code 0 screenshot/paste required
   - Binary size verification required

2. **Type Assertion Checklist**
   - For all refactoring tasks, require explicit type assertion grep
   - Provide grep patterns in worker prompt
   - Verify zero type assertion mismatches before claiming complete

3. **Acceptable Debt Documentation**
   - Continue Task 1.4 pattern of documenting why references remain
   - Provide justification (API contracts, deployment paths, etc.)
   - Distinguish between "acceptable" and "needs fixing"

**Worker Guidance:**

1. **Discovery First**
   - Always grep ALL references before starting refactor
   - Create reference count baseline
   - Track progress systematically

2. **Test Frequently**
   - Compile after each major change
   - Don't wait until end to test
   - Catch errors early

3. **Document Thoroughly**
   - Explain all decisions
   - Justify acceptable technical debt
   - Provide evidence of testing

## üö® CRITICAL INCIDENT RESOLVED

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Problem:** VMA 232 was causing data corruption on multi-disk VMs

**Root Cause:**  
VMA 232's deployment on Oct 2 received a WRONG/CORRUPTED vma-api-server binary (MD5: `def32662a78fb9a0fb7de29a574ae4d1`) that had buggy disk-to-NBD-target mapping logic. This caused all disks to write to the SAME destination, resulting in the second disk overwriting the first disk's partition table.

**Evidence:**  
Screenshots showed VMA 232 writing `vdc` (10G) partition table to `vdb` (115G), corrupting the larger disk.

**Fix Applied:**  
1. Built correct vma-api-server from `source/current/` (MD5: `200fd75e80bc13c14f45427044c1e0e9`)
2. Deployed to VMA 232 on October 3, 2025 14:18 UTC
3. Verified correct disk mapping in logs: Each disk maps to separate NBD target with proper VMware disk keys (2000, 2001)

**Verification:**  
- VMA API logs show: `"üéØ Added NBD target with VMware disk key"` for each disk separately
- Command line shows: `--nbd-targets 2000:nbd://...vol-101328f1...,2001:nbd://...vol-ec4b3a8d...`
- Test replication of pgtest1 multi-disk VM confirmed working correctly

## ‚úÖ Deployment Instructions

**For Future VMA Deployments:**

1. **Use ONLY these binaries** from this directory
2. **Verify MD5 hashes** before deployment:
   ```bash
   md5sum vma-api-server migratekit
   ```
3. **Expected hashes:**
   - vma-api-server: `200fd75e80bc13c14f45427044c1e0e9`
   - migratekit: `0a2e773653c47b8923809ee5df6e6ffa`

4. **Deploy to VMA:**
   ```bash
   scp vma-api-server vma@VMA_IP:/tmp/
   scp migratekit vma@VMA_IP:/tmp/
   ssh vma@VMA_IP "sudo mv /tmp/vma-api-server /opt/vma/bin/ && sudo mv /tmp/migratekit /opt/vma/bin/"
   ```

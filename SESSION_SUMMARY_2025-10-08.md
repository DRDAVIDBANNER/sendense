# Session Summary - October 8, 2025

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully completed **complete backup architecture refactoring** AND fixed **stale qemu-nbd resource leak bug**.

---

## ✅ Major Achievements

### 1. Phase 4 Complete - Backup Context Architecture ✅

**Eliminated fragile timestamp-window hack** and implemented proper database relationships.

#### What Was Built:
- ✅ `vm_backup_contexts` table for VM-level tracking
- ✅ `backup_disks` table for per-disk change_id storage  
- ✅ Parent `backup_jobs` record created FIRST (fixes FK constraint)
- ✅ Proper CASCADE DELETE relationships
- ✅ Direct FK lookups (no more guessing!)

#### End-to-End Test Results:
```
Full Backup (backup-pgtest1-1759946759):
  Disk 0: ✅ Completed with change_id stored
  Disk 1: ✅ Completed with change_id stored

Incremental Backup (backup-pgtest1-1759947265):
  Disk 0: ✅ Completed with backing chain to parent
  Disk 1: ✅ Completed with backing chain to parent
```

### 2. QCOW2 Incremental Backup Chains ✅

**Working QCOW2 backing file architecture verified:**

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         DISK 0 (102 GB)                    ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝

FULL → backup-pgtest1-disk0-20251008-190559.qcow2
         (no backing file)
         Change ID: ...fd 7d/5531
         
         ↓

INCREMENTAL → backup-pgtest1-disk0-20251008-191425.qcow2
                backing file: ↑ parent QCOW2 ✅
                Change ID: ...fd 7e/5532

╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║         DISK 1 (5 GB)                      ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝

FULL → backup-pgtest1-disk1-20251008-190559.qcow2
         (no backing file)
         Change ID: ...1f b3/4523
         
         ↓

INCREMENTAL → backup-pgtest1-disk1-20251008-191425.qcow2
                backing file: ↑ parent QCOW2 ✅
                Change ID: ...1f b3/4524
```

**Verified:**
- ✅ Full backups have no backing files
- ✅ Incremental backups reference correct parent QCOW2
- ✅ Change IDs stored in backup_disks table
- ✅ Multi-disk backups working perfectly

---

### 3. Stale qemu-nbd Bug FIXED ✅

**Problem:** qemu-nbd processes remained running after backup completion, causing:
- Resource leak (processes never cleaned up)
- Port exhaustion (ports never released)  
- Locked QCOW2 files (couldn't inspect with qemu-img)

**Solution:** Added automatic cleanup in `CompleteBackup()`:
```go
// When all disks complete, find NBD ports by VM name
ports := be.portAllocator.GetPortsForBackupJob(backupID)
for _, port := range ports {
    be.qemuManager.Stop(port)      // Stop qemu-nbd
    be.portAllocator.Release(port) // Release port
}
```

**Test Result:**
```
Before completion: 2 qemu-nbd processes running
After completion:  0 qemu-nbd processes ✅
```

**Status:** 🎉 **WORKING PERFECTLY!**

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Modified:

1. **sha/database/backup_job_repository.go**
   - Added `VMBackupContext` model
   - Added `BackupDisk` model

2. **sha/workflows/backup.go**
   - Added `ParentJobID` to `BackupRequest`
   - Rewrote `CompleteBackup()` for `backup_disks` table
   - Added qemu-nbd cleanup logic

3. **sha/storage/interface.go**
   - Added `ParentJobID` to storage `BackupRequest`

4. **sha/storage/local_repository.go**
   - Create `backup_disks` records with parent job ID
   - Proper FK relationships

5. **sha/api/handlers/backup_handlers.go**
   - Create `vm_backup_contexts` (find or create)
   - Create parent `backup_jobs` record FIRST
   - Pass context IDs through stack

6. **sha/services/nbd_port_allocator.go**
   - Added `GetPortsForBackupJob()` method
   - Matches ports by VM name for cleanup

### Database Changes:

```sql
-- New tables
vm_backup_contexts (master context per VM+repository)
backup_disks (per-disk tracking with FK to backup_jobs)

-- Fixed constraints
fk_backup_job_context: CASCADE DELETE (was SET NULL)
fk_backup_disk_job: CASCADE DELETE to backup_jobs
fk_backup_disk_context: CASCADE DELETE to vm_backup_contexts
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Right:
1. **Phased approach** (1→2→3→4) caught issues early
2. **Asked for architectural decision** (Option 2) instead of guessing
3. **Real testing** with pgtest1 VM (no simulation)
4. **Iterative fixes** v2.16.0 → v2.16.1 → v2.16.2 → v2.17.0
5. **End-to-end validation** proved everything works

### Bugs Found & Fixed:
1. **FK constraint violation** - Parent backup_jobs didn't exist
   - Fix: Create parent record FIRST in handler
   
2. **Stale qemu-nbd processes** - Never cleaned up after completion  
   - Fix: Automatic cleanup in CompleteBackup()

## 🎯 Outstanding Items

### Optional Enhancements:
- [ ] API documentation updates (deferred)

# ðŸŽ¯ GROK: Protection Flows GUI - Final Integration

Hey Grok! ðŸ‘‹

You've done fantastic work on the backend (Tasks 1-5 complete). Now we're at the final GUI integration phase, but we have TWO problems to solve:

---

## ðŸš¨ Problem 1: Light Mode Support Broken (Your Fault ðŸ˜…)

During your modal-to-panel refactoring, you hardcoded dark mode colors everywhere:
- `bg-gray-900` instead of `bg-background`
- `text-white` instead of `text-foreground`  
- `border-gray-700` instead of `border-border`

**This broke light mode support.** Every other page in the GUI supports light/dark mode switching. Protection Flows is the ONLY broken page.

---

## ðŸš¨ Problem 2: Still Using Mock Data

The Protection Flows page is still using mock data. Backend API is ready and deployed at `http://localhost:8082/api/v1/protection-flows`, but GUI isn't using it yet.

## ðŸ“‹ Your Task

Read the comprehensive job sheet at:
**`/home/oma_admin/sendense/job-sheets/GROK-TASK-6-gui-wiring-plus-theme-fix.md`**

This job sheet contains:
1. âœ… Complete explanation of the theme system
2. âœ… All files that need fixing
3. âœ… Before/after code examples for theme fixes
4. âœ… Complete API service layer code
5. âœ… Complete React Query hooks code
6. âœ… Component update patterns
7. âœ… Completion checklist
8. âœ… Testing instructions

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Execution Order

### Step 1: Fix Theme Support (DO THIS FIRST) âš¡
1. Fix `app/protection-flows/page.tsx` - replace ALL hardcoded colors
2. Fix `components/features/protection-flows/FlowDetailsPanel.tsx` - replace ALL hardcoded colors
3. Fix `components/features/protection-flows/JobLogsDrawer.tsx` - replace ALL hardcoded colors
4. Test in light mode (remove `className="dark"` from `app/layout.tsx`)
5. Test in dark mode (restore `className="dark"`)

**Show me a git diff after this step.**

### Step 2: Wire API Integration ðŸ”Œ
1. Create API service layer: `src/features/protection-flows/api/protectionFlowsApi.ts`
2. Create React Query hooks: `src/features/protection-flows/hooks/useProtectionFlows.ts`
3. Update `page.tsx` to use real API hooks
4. Update `FlowDetailsPanel.tsx` to use real execution data
5. Remove ALL mock data
6. Add loading states
7. Add error handling
8. Test CRUD operations

**Show me a git diff after this step.**

## âœ… Success Criteria

**Theme Fix:**
- [ ] No hardcoded `bg-gray-*` anywhere
- [ ] No hardcoded `text-white` anywhere  
- [ ] No hardcoded `border-gray-*` anywhere
- [ ] Page looks professional in BOTH light and dark mode

**API Wiring:**
- [ ] No mock data remaining
- [ ] All CRUD operations use real API
- [ ] Loading states during operations
- [ ] Error handling for failures
- [ ] Auto-refresh for live updates
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with no errors

## ðŸ“š Key Reference

**Theme System Tokens (from globals.css):**
```css
/* Use these Tailwind classes: */
bg-background        /* Page background */
text-foreground      /* Primary text */
bg-card              /* Card/panel background */
text-card-foreground /* Card text */
bg-muted             /* Secondary background */
text-muted-foreground /* Secondary text */
border-border        /* Borders */
bg-primary           /* Primary action color */
text-primary         /* Primary text color */
```

**API Base URL:**
```
http://localhost:8082/api/v1/protection-flows
```

## ðŸ”¥ Let's Go!

1. Read the full job sheet
2. Fix theme support FIRST (show diff)
3. Wire API integration SECOND (show diff)
4. Run completion checklist
5. Confirm all tests pass

You got this! ðŸ’ª

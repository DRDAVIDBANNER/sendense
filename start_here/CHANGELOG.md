## [Unreleased]

---

## [SHA v2.25.7-individual-vm-machines-fix] - 2025-10-10

### Fixed - **Individual VM Flows Machines Panel**
- **Problem:** Individual VM protection flows (like `pgtest1`) not showing machine data in "Machines" tab
- **Root Cause:** Frontend calling non-existent `GET /api/v1/vm-contexts/{context_id}` endpoint
- **Solution:** Added proper backend endpoint and updated frontend API calls

### Backend Changes
- **New API Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/vm-contexts/by-id/{context_id}`
- **New Handler:** `GetVMContextByID` in `vm_contexts.go`
- **New Repository Method:** `GetVMContextByIDWithFullDetails` in `repository.go`
- **Route Added:** `/vm-contexts/by-id/{context_id}` in `server.go`

### Frontend Changes
- **Updated:** `getFlowMachines` function in `protectionFlowsApi.ts`
- **Fixed:** API call to use new endpoint for individual VM flows
- **Fixed:** Response parsing to extract `response.data.context`

### Testing Results
- ✅ Individual VM flow (`pgtest1`): Now shows machine data correctly
- ✅ Group-based flow (`pgtest3`): Continues to work as before
- ✅ All API endpoints tested and working

### Files Modified
- `source/current/sha/api/handlers/vm_contexts.go`
- `source/current/sha/database/repository.go`
- `source/current/sha/api/server.go`
- `source/current/sendense-gui/src/features/protection-flows/api/protectionFlowsApi.ts`

### Binary
- `sha-api-v2.25.7-vm-context-by-id` deployed to production

## [SNA Backup Client v1.0.2-snapshot-jobid] - 2025-10-09

### Changed - **VMware Snapshot Naming (Job-Specific Isolation)**
- **Problem:** All snapshots named "migratekit" (hardcoded), causing conflicts between concurrent jobs
- **Impact:** Multiple backups or replications on same VM would delete each other's snapshots
- **Solution:** Job-specific snapshot names with type prefixes
  - **Backup jobs**: `sbak-{jobID}` (e.g., `sbak-backup-backup-pgtest3-1760025105`)
  - **Replication jobs**: `srep-{jobID}` (e.g., `srep-repl-pgtest3-1760025105`)
  - Each job type only deletes snapshots with matching prefix (safe isolation)
  
### Technical Implementation
- **Added Fields to NbdkitServers:**
  - `JobID string` - Full job identifier from command line
  - `SnapshotPrefix string` - Computed prefix ("sbak-" or "srep-")
  
- **New Helper Functions:**
  - `getSnapshotPrefix(jobID string)` - Determines prefix based on job ID pattern
  - `deleteOldSnapshots(...)` - Recursively finds and deletes only matching-prefix snapshots
  
- **Updated Snapshot Lifecycle:**
  - **At START**: Delete old snapshots matching current job's prefix only
  - **Create snapshot**: Use `{prefix}{jobID}` as name
  - **At END**: Delete current job's snapshot (existing logic preserved)
  
- **Files Modified:**
  - `internal/vmware_nbdkit/vmware_nbdkit.go` - Updated struct and createSnapshot()
  - `main.go` - Added prefix detection, safe deletion logic, updated constructor calls

### Safety Features
- ✅ Backup jobs ONLY delete `sbak-*` snapshots (won't touch replications)
- ✅ Replication jobs ONLY delete `srep-*` snapshots (won't touch backups)
- ✅ Won't interfere with user-created snapshots or other systems
- ✅ Supports concurrent backups/replications without conflicts
- ✅ Recursive snapshot tree traversal (handles nested snapshots)

### Binary
- `sendense-backup-client-v1.0.2-snapshot-jobid` (~20MB)
- Deployed to `/usr/local/bin/sendense-backup-client` on SNA

## [SHA v2.25.5-critical-fixes] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed - **Critical Production Bugs** 🔥
- **FIXED: credential_id Not Stored When Adding VMs**
  - **Impact:** VMs added via GUI had `credential_id = NULL`, breaking backups with error: "VM context has no credential_id set"
  - **Root Cause:** Handler received `credential_id` but lost it when passing to service layer
  - **Fix:** Added `CredentialID` field to `DiscoveryRequest` struct, passed through 4-layer call chain
  - **Result:** VMs now properly linked to vCenter credentials, backups work, multi-vCenter support enabled
  - **Files:** `services/enhanced_discovery_service.go`, `api/handlers/enhanced_discovery.go`
  
- **FIXED: Partition Path Navigation (Nested Directories)**
  - **Impact:** Could browse partition root but clicking subdirectories failed (breadcrumb showed wrong path)
  - **Root Cause:** GUI sent `/Partition 3 (100.4 GB)/PerfLogs/file.txt`, backend only converted root to `/partition-3` (lost subdirectory path)
  - **Fix:** Added `convertDisplayPathToFilesystemPath()` to properly split path segments and preserve subdirectory structure
  - **Result:** Full nested navigation works, proper breadcrumb paths
  - **Example:** `/Partition 3 (100.4 GB)/PerfLogs/System Volume Information` → `/partition-3/PerfLogs/System Volume Information`
  - **File:** `source/current/sha/restore/file_browser.go`

### Testing Status
- ✅ pgtest2 added with credential_id = 35 (automatic)
- ✅ pgtest3 backup running from protection group flow (uses stored credential_id)
- ✅ Partition navigation working (root + nested directories)
- ✅ File browser fully operational with multi-level folder navigation

### Technical Details
**credential_id Fix:**
- Modified 5 code locations across 2 files
- Updated 4 function signatures to pass credential_id through call chain
- Handler → Service → processDiscoveredVMs → createVMContext → Database
- Added credential_id to VMReplicationContext struct and logging

**Partition Navigation Fix:**
- New helper: `convertDisplayPathToFilesystemPath()` splits and reconstructs paths
- Handles display names: `"Partition N - Label (Size)"` → filesystem paths: `/partition-N/path`
- Preserves full subdirectory structure in nested navigation

---

## [SHA v2.25.4-multi-partition-mounts] - 2025-10-09

### Added - **Multi-Partition Mount Support** 🎉
- **NEW: Mount ALL Partitions Automatically**
  - Backend detects and mounts **all mountable partitions** from backup disks
  - GUI file browser shows partitions as virtual folders at root level
  - Users can browse **each partition independently** (data, recovery, EFI, etc.)
  - Example: Windows disk shows "Partition 1 - Recovery (1.5 GB)", "Partition 2 - EFI (100 MB)", "Partition 3 (100.4 GB)"

### Backend Implementation
- **Multi-Partition Detection** (`restore/mount_manager.go`):
  - New: `performMultiPartitionMount()` orchestrates mounting all partitions
  - New: `mountAllPartitions()` enumerates partitions using `lsblk -rno NAME,SIZE,FSTYPE,LABEL`
  - Skips tiny partitions (<1MB) - usually reserved/alignment partitions
  - Creates subdirectories: `/mnt/restore/{mount_id}/partition-1/`, `/partition-2/`, etc.
  - Attempts to mount each partition, logs success/failure per partition
  - Stores partition metadata as JSON in database (`partition_metadata` column)

- **Partition Metadata Storage** (`database/restore_mount_repository.go`):
  - Added `PartitionMetadata` field to `RestoreMount` struct
  - JSON structure: `{"partitions": [{"partition_name": "nbd0p1", "size": 1610612736, "filesystem": "ntfs", "label": "Recovery"}]}`
  - Database migration: `20251009160000_add_partition_metadata.up.sql`

- **File Browser Multi-Partition Support** (`restore/file_browser.go`):
  - New: `listPartitionFolders()` creates virtual directory entries at root
  - Generates friendly names: `"Partition 1 - Recovery (1.5 GB)"`, `"Partition 3 (100.4 GB)"`
  - New: `listFilesInPartition()` handles browsing within specific partitions
  - Path format: `/partition-N/subdir/file.txt` for actual filesystem access

- **Clean Unmount** (`restore/mount_manager.go`):
  - New: `unmountAllPartitions()` unmounts all partition subdirectories
  - Backward compatible: also handles single-partition mounts
  - Proper cleanup of all mount points before NBD device disconnect

### Frontend Implementation
- **Partition Display** (`src/features/restore/types/index.ts`):
  - Added `partition_metadata?: string` to `RestoreMount` interface
  - File browser automatically displays partitions as clickable folders
  - Each partition shows as a separate folder with size and label info

### Technical Highlights
- **Smart Partition Selection**: Uses `lsblk` output to enumerate partitions dynamically
- **Filesystem Detection**: Automatically detects NTFS, FAT32, EXT4, etc. for proper mount options
- **Error Handling**: Failed partition mounts logged but don't fail entire operation
- **Backward Compatible**: Single-partition mounts still work (legacy backups)

### Testing Status
- ✅ Windows disk with 5 partitions (1.5GB recovery + 100MB EFI + 15.8MB reserved + 100.4GB C: drive + 256KB reserved)
- ✅ Mounted 3 partitions successfully (skipped unmountable reserved partitions)
- ✅ GUI displays partitions as folders at root level
- ✅ Can browse each partition independently
- ✅ Partition metadata stored in database
- ✅ Clean unmount works for all partitions

### Files Modified
- `source/current/sha/restore/mount_manager.go` (392 lines: +340, -52)
- `source/current/sha/restore/file_browser.go` (90+ lines added)
- `source/current/sha/database/restore_mount_repository.go` (1 field added)
- `source/current/sendense-gui/src/features/restore/types/index.ts` (1 field added)
- Database migration: `20251009160000_add_partition_metadata.up.sql`

## [SHA v2.25.3-file-restore-production] - 2025-10-09

### Added - **File-Level Restore - Production Ready** 🎉
- **NEW: Complete File-Level Restore System**
  - Mount QCOW2 backup disks via NBD for file browsing
  - Browse Windows/Linux filesystems with intuitive file browser GUI
  - Download individual files or entire directories (auto-zip)
  - Intelligent partition auto-selection (largest partition = data partition)
  - Professional file browser with search, selection, and download capabilities

### Backend Implementation
- **Intelligent Partition Selection** (`restore/mount_manager.go`):
  - Auto-detects and mounts **largest partition** (usually the data partition)
  - Uses `lsblk -rno NAME,SIZE` to enumerate all partitions
  - Parses sizes (K/M/G/TB) and selects partition with most storage
  - Logs selection: `"Auto-selected largest partition (likely data partition) partition=/dev/nbd0p4 size=100.4 GB"`
  - **Windows Example:** Auto-selects p4 (100GB C: drive) instead of p1 (1.5GB recovery partition)
  - **Fallback chain:** largest → p1 → raw device

- **Auto-Zip Directory Downloads** (`api/handlers/restore_handlers.go`):
  - File download endpoint now detects if path is a directory
  - Automatically switches to ZIP archive creation
  - Seamless UX - user clicks download, gets `FolderName.zip`
  - **Implementation:** Error detection + fallback to `DownloadDirectory` with ZIP format
  - Logs: `"Directory downloaded as ZIP successfully (auto-zip)"`

- **Bug Fixes** (Multiple Critical Issues):
  1. **Backup Listing Duplicates** (`backup_handlers.go` lines 533-540):
     - Issue: Users saw 3x duplicate backups (parent + disk0 + disk1 as separate entries)
     - Fix: Filter out per-disk records (`backup_id` NOT LIKE `%-disk%-%`)
     - Result: Now shows 6 clean backups instead of 18+ duplicates
     - Added `disks_count` field to API response (queries `backup_disks` table)
  
  2. **Mount SQL Column Mismatch** (`restore_mount_repository.go`):
     - Issue: 500 error - `Unknown column 'backup_id' in 'SELECT'`
     - Root Cause: SQL queries used `backup_id`, but v2.16.0+ schema uses `backup_disk_id`
     - Fix: Changed 2 SQL queries (lines 116, 139): `backup_id` → `backup_disk_id`
     - Result: Mount operations now work without SQL errors
  
  3. **lsblk Tree Characters** (`mount_manager.go`):
     - Issue: Mount trying to access `/dev/├─nbd0p4` (invalid path with tree formatting chars)
     - Root Cause: `lsblk -no` output included tree characters (`├─`, `└─`)
     - Fix: Changed to `lsblk -rno` (raw mode) for clean output
     - Result: Clean partition names without special characters
  
  4. **Stale Mount Records** (Operational Issue):
     - Issue: Failed mounts leaving `failed` status records in database, blocking future attempts
     - Workaround: Manual cleanup of failed records
     - **Note:** Auto-cleanup logic needed for production stability

### Frontend Implementation
- **File Browser GUI** (`components/features/restore/`):
  - Professional file browser with Windows/Linux filesystem support
  - Search functionality with real-time filtering
  - Multi-select with bulk download capabilities
  - Download buttons: Individual files (📥) and folders (📦 auto-zip)
  - Sticky table headers and responsive design
  - Empty states and loading indicators

- **Backup Selector** (`components/features/restore/BackupSelector.tsx`):
  - Fixed API endpoint: `GET /api/v1/backups?vm_name={name}&status=completed`
  - Displays backup metadata: date, size, disk count
  - Now shows clean backup list (no duplicates)
  - Proper disk count display: "• 2 disks" (not "NaN undefined")

### Technical Highlights
- **NBD Mount Infrastructure**: QCOW2 → qemu-nbd → NBD device → mount → browse
- **Read-Only Safety**: All mounts are read-only (`-o ro`) to prevent data modification
- **Partition Detection**: Uses `lsblk` for dynamic partition enumeration (works for any OS)
- **Size Parsing**: Custom `parseSizeToBytes()` function converts "100.4G" → bytes for comparison
- **Streaming Downloads**: Uses `io.Pipe()` for memory-efficient ZIP streaming

### Testing Status
- ✅ Backup listing fixed (6 backups shown instead of 18+)
- ✅ Mount operations working (no SQL errors)
- ✅ Largest partition auto-selected (nbd0p4 100GB instead of nbd0p1 1.5GB)
- ✅ File browser working (pgtest1 Windows filesystem browsable)
- ✅ File downloads working (individual files)
- ✅ Directory downloads working (auto-zip functionality)
- ✅ End-to-end test: Selected pgtest1 backup → mounted → browsed Windows C: drive → downloaded Users folder as ZIP

### Known Issues/Future Enhancements
- ⚠️ **Stale Mount Cleanup**: Failed mounts should auto-clean database records
- 📋 **Single Partition Mount**: Currently mounts only largest partition (Option 2: mount ALL partitions planned)
- 📋 **Mount Slot Display**: GUI shows technical mount info, could be more user-friendly

### Files Modified
- Backend:
  - `sha/restore/mount_manager.go` (partition auto-selection logic, 102 lines added)
  - `sha/database/restore_mount_repository.go` (SQL column fix, 2 queries)
  - `sha/api/handlers/restore_handlers.go` (auto-zip logic, 39 lines added)
  - `sha/api/handlers/backup_handlers.go` (duplicate filtering, disks_count field)

- Frontend:
  - `sendense-gui/src/features/restore/api/restoreApi.ts` (API endpoint fix)
  - `sendense-gui/src/features/restore/hooks/useRestore.ts` (parameter updates)
  - `sendense-gui/components/features/restore/BackupSelector.tsx` (state management fix)

### Performance Metrics
- **Mount Time:** < 2 seconds for 100GB QCOW2 disk
- **File Listing:** Instant for directories with 1000s of files
- **Download Speed:** Limited by disk I/O and network (NBD device read-only access)
- **ZIP Creation:** Streaming (memory-efficient, no disk space required)

### User Experience Improvements
- **Before:** Mount showed recovery partition with limited system files
- **After:** Mount shows main Windows C: drive with user data
- **Before:** Clicking download on folder gave error
- **After:** Auto-zips folder seamlessly
- **Before:** Backup list showed 18+ confusing duplicate entries
- **After:** Clean backup list with proper disk counts

### Documentation
- Job sheet created: `job-sheets/2025-10-09-fix-backup-listing-duplicates.md` (571 lines)
- Grok prompt created: `job-sheets/GROK-PROMPT-fix-backup-listing.md` (149 lines)

## [SHA v2.25.2-protection-flows-engine] - 2025-10-09

### Added - **Protection Flows Engine (Phase 1 Complete)** 🚀
- **NEW: Automated Backup Orchestration Engine**
  - Create protection flows for individual VMs or entire groups
  - Intelligent full/incremental detection (first backup full, subsequent incremental)
  - Schedule-based automated execution (integrates with existing SchedulerService)
  - Manual "Run Now" execution from GUI
  - Comprehensive status tracking and execution history
  
### Backend Implementation
- **15 New API Endpoints** (`sha/api/handlers/protection_flow_handlers.go`):
  - `POST /protection-flows` - Create flow (VM or group targeting)
  - `GET /protection-flows` - List all flows with status
  - `GET /protection-flows/summary` - Dashboard statistics
  - `GET /protection-flows/{id}` - Get single flow details
  - `PUT /protection-flows/{id}` - Update flow configuration
  - `DELETE /protection-flows/{id}` - Delete flow (CASCADE removes executions)
  - `POST /protection-flows/{id}/execute` - Manual execution
  - `GET /protection-flows/{id}/executions` - Execution history
  - `GET /protection-flows/{id}/status` - Real-time status
  - Plus 6 bulk operation endpoints (bulk-execute, bulk-enable, bulk-disable, bulk-delete)

- **Database Schema** (`database/migrations/20251009120000_create_protection_flows.up.sql`):
  - `protection_flows` table: Flow definitions with target (VM/group), repository, schedule, policy
  - `protection_flow_executions` table: Execution history with CASCADE DELETE
  - Foreign Keys: FK to backup_repositories, replication_schedules (collation issue deferred), backup_policies
  - Indexes: flow_type, target, enabled, last_execution_status, execution_type

- **Service Layer** (`services/protection_flow_service.go`, 589 lines):
  - `CreateFlow()` - Flow creation with validation
  - `ExecuteFlow()` - Orchestrates backup execution (resolves VMs, calls backup API)
  - `ProcessBackupFlow()` - Intelligent backup type detection (checks backup_jobs for existing full backup)
  - `UpdateFlowStatistics()` - Tracks execution success/failure counts
  - Integration with SchedulerService for automated execution

- **Repository Layer** (`database/flow_repository.go`, 427 lines):
  - Complete CRUD operations for flows and executions
  - Status tracking and statistics aggregation
  - Execution history queries with pagination

### Frontend Implementation
- **GUI Integration** (Next.js 15 + React 19):
  - Protection Flows page with table, modals, and status tracking
  - Create/Edit Flow modals with VM/group selection
  - Real-time execution status with nested status object
  - "Run Now" button triggers manual execution
  - Theme support: Semantic tokens for light/dark mode compatibility

### Technical Highlights
- **Intelligent Backup Detection**: Queries `backup_jobs` table to determine if full backup exists; if yes, uses incremental
- **Job Type Compatibility**: Uses `job_type="scheduler"` for compatibility with existing `job_tracking` ENUM
- **Multi-Disk Support**: Backup API handles all VM disks automatically; GUI shows aggregated status
- **CASCADE DELETE**: Deleting flow auto-removes all execution records (database constraint)
- **Scheduler Integration**: Protection flows can be scheduled via existing replication_schedules system

### Testing Status
- ✅ Flow creation working (GUI + API)
- ✅ Manual execution working (backup flows)
- ✅ Incremental backup detection working (queries backup_jobs for full backup)
- ✅ Multi-disk VM support working (pgtest1: disk 0 + disk 1)
- ✅ Flow status tracking working (nested status object)
- ✅ GUI wiring complete (Protection Flows page functional)
- ✅ End-to-end test: Created flow for pgtest1, executed manually, incremental backup started successfully

### Known Issues/Deferred
- ⚠️ Foreign key constraint for `schedule_id` deferred due to collation mismatch (utf8mb4_unicode_ci vs utf8mb4_general_ci)
- 📋 Replication flows return "not implemented" (planned for Phase 5)

## [SHA v2.24.1-restore-query-fix] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- **Database Query Fix**: Corrected stale RAW SQL query in `restore_mount_repository.go` ListExpired() method
  - Changed `SELECT backup_id` to `SELECT backup_disk_id` to match actual table schema
  - Eliminated "Unknown column 'backup_id' in 'SELECT'" error at SHA startup
  - Cleanup service now runs without errors
  - Root cause: Table schema was already correct (backup_disk_id), but one raw SQL query was using old field name
  - File: `source/current/sha/database/restore_mount_repository.go:160`
  - Binary: `/home/oma_admin/sendense/source/builds/sendense-hub-v2.24.1-restore-query-fix`

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Updated `DB_SCHEMA.md` with complete restore_mounts table specification
  - Added v2.16.0+ architecture notes (backup_disk_id FK to backup_disks.id)
  - Documented CASCADE DELETE chain: vm_backup_contexts → backup_jobs → backup_disks → restore_mounts
  - Added all field names, indexes, and unique constraints

---

## [SHA v2.24.0-restore-v2-refactor] - 2025-10-08

### Fixed
- **File-Level Restore v2.16.0+ Compatibility** (CRITICAL REFACTOR):
  - **Problem**: Restore system written Oct 5 for OLD backup architecture broke with v2.16.0+ schema changes
  - **Root Cause**: v2.16.0 moved QCOW2 paths from `backup_jobs.repository_path` to `backup_disks.qcow2_path`
  - **Impact**: Complete restore functionality broken - couldn't mount any backups
  - **Solution**: Comprehensive refactor of restore system for v2.16.0+ multi-disk architecture
  
### Changed
- **Database Schema**:
  - `restore_mounts` table now uses `backup_disk_id BIGINT` FK to `backup_disks.id` (was `backup_id`)
  - Integrated with CASCADE DELETE chain: `vm_backup_contexts → backup_jobs → backup_disks → restore_mounts`
  - Migration: `20251008160000_add_restore_tables.up.sql` (tested and working)

- **Core Restore Logic** (`restore/mount_manager.go`):
  - Added `disk_index` parameter to `MountRequest` for multi-disk VM support
  - Rewrote `findBackupFile()` → `findBackupDiskFile()` - queries `backup_disks` table directly
  - Updated `MountBackup()` method to handle per-disk mounting
  - Added `database.Connection` dependency for direct `backup_disks` queries
  - `MountInfo` now includes `backup_disk_id` and `disk_index` fields

- **Database Repository** (`database/restore_mount_repository.go`):
  - `RestoreMount` model updated - uses `BackupDiskID int64` (was `BackupID string`)
  - Created `GetByBackupDiskID()` method for FK-based queries
  - Updated `Create()` and `GetByID()` methods for new schema
  - Added GORM column tags for proper mapping

- **API Handlers** (`api/handlers/restore_handlers.go`):
  - `NewRestoreHandlers()` now passes DB connection to `MountManager`
  - `MountBackup()` validates `disk_index` parameter (defaults to 0 for backward compat)
  - Enhanced logging with `backup_disk_id` and `disk_index` fields

- **Cleanup Service** (`restore/cleanup_service.go`):
  - Updated logging to reference `backup_disk_id` instead of `backup_id`

### Technical Details
- **Binary**: `sendense-hub-v2.24.0-restore-v2-refactor` (34MB)
- **Compilation**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL - No linter errors
- **Files Modified**: 5 files (migration + 4 source files)
- **Lines Changed**: ~200 lines across core restore system
- **Job Sheet**: `job-sheets/2025-10-08-restore-system-v2-refactor.md`

### API Changes
**Mount Request (Backward Compatible):**
```json
{
  "backup_id": "backup-pgtest1-1759947871",
  "disk_index": 0
}
```
- `disk_index` defaults to 0 if not provided (backward compatibility)
- Multi-disk VMs: specify which disk to mount (0, 1, 2...)

**Mount Response:**
```json
{
  "mount_id": "...",
  "backup_id": "backup-pgtest1-1759947871",
  "backup_disk_id": 12345,
  "disk_index": 0,
  "mount_path": "/mnt/sendense/restore/...",
  "nbd_device": "/dev/nbd0",
  "status": "mounted"
}
```

### Testing Status
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: Integration testing with pgtest1 disk 0 (102GB Windows) - ALL TESTS PASSED
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: File-level restore end-to-end workflow validated (mount → browse → download → unmount)
- ✅ **COMPLETE**: API documentation updated in `api-documentation/OMA.md` (287 lines comprehensive docs)

## [SHA v2.22.0-chain-fix-v2] - 2025-10-08

### Fixed
- **Backup Chain Metadata Tracking** (CRITICAL):
  - Fixed `backup_chains` table not incrementing `total_backups` count after incremental backups
  - Fixed per-disk `backup_jobs` status not updating to "completed"
  - Root cause: Per-disk job ID lookup was generating IDs instead of querying database
  - Solution: Query actual per-disk `backup_jobs` records using context ID, backup type, disk index pattern, and time window
  - Added `AddBackupToChain()` calls in completion workflow to update chain metadata
  - Result: Chain counts now accurate, all 8 per-disk jobs show "completed" status
  - Testing: 4th incremental backup confirmed chain increment from 4 to 5

  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Multi-disk backup corruption bug FIXED
  - **Problem**: Both disks received same VMware disk key 2000 (should be 2000, 2001)
  - **Root Cause**: Binary deployment issue - v2.20.7-disk-key-fix never deployed, symlink pointed to v2.20.3
  - **Impact**: sendense-backup-client would write 102GB disk to wrong 5GB target causing data corruption
  - **Solution**: 
    - Built new debug binary v2.20.8-disk-key-debug with enhanced logging
    - Updated symlink /usr/local/bin/sendense-hub to point to new binary
    - Verified disk key calculation: loop index i correctly generates 2000, 2001, 2002...
  - **Evidence**: Debug logs show correct disk keys:
    - Disk 0: disk_key=2000, export=pgtest1-disk-2000
    - Disk 1: disk_key=2001, export=pgtest1-disk-2001
    - Final NBD targets: "2000:nbd://127.0.0.1:10100/pgtest1-disk-2000,2001:nbd://127.0.0.1:10101/pgtest1-disk-2001"

  - **Technical Debt**: 5 legacy CloudStack references remain in comments (named pipe patterns, not used)
  - **Job Sheet**: `job-sheets/2025-10-07-unified-nbd-architecture.md` (Task 1.3 complete)
  
- **SendenseBackupClient Dynamic Port Configuration** (October 7, 2025):
  - **Task 1.2 Complete**: Added --nbd-host and --nbd-port CLI flags for dynamic NBD connections
  - **New Flags**: --nbd-host (default: 127.0.0.1), --nbd-port (default: 10808)
  - **Backwards Compatible**: Defaults match hardcoded values (10808)
  - **Implementation**: main.go lines 75-76 (variables), 239-240 (context), 423-424 (flags)
  - **Target Integration**: nbd.go reads from context, falls back to defaults

### Fixed
- **qemu-nbd Connection Limit Causing migratekit Hang** (October 7, 2025):
  - **Critical Investigation**: 10+ hours systematic testing discovered qemu-nbd connection limit issue
  - **Root Cause**: qemu-nbd defaults to `--shared=1` (single client connection)
  - **Problem**: migratekit opens 2 NBD connections per export (metadata + data), second connection blocked forever
  - **Solution**: Start qemu-nbd with `--shared=5` or higher to allow multiple concurrent connections
  - **False Leads**: Spent 8 hours investigating SSH tunnel as root cause (red herring - direct TCP had identical hang)
  - **Breakthrough**: Debug logging revealed hang inside `ConnectTcp()` on second connection attempt
  - **Verification**: Both SSH tunnel and direct TCP tested successfully with `--shared` flag
  - **Performance**: 130 Mbps direct, 10-15 Mbps via SSH tunnel (encryption overhead as expected)
  - **Investigation Job Sheet**: `job-sheets/2025-10-07-qemu-nbd-tunnel-investigation.md` (1560+ lines)
  - **Architecture Job Sheet**: `job-sheets/2025-10-07-unified-nbd-architecture.md` (implementation plan)
  - **Phase 1 Goals Updated**: Added Task 7 - Unified NBD Architecture to `phase-1-vmware-backup.md`
  - **API Documentation**: Added NBD Port Management endpoints to `OMA.md`
  - **Impact**: Unlocks backup operations via SSH tunnel, enables multi-disk backups, production-ready solution
  
- **VM Disks Table Not Populated During Discovery** (October 6, 2025):
  - **Critical Architectural Fix**: vm_disks table now populated immediately when VMs are added to management
  - Schema migration: Made vm_disks.job_id nullable to support disk records from discovery
  - Discovery service now creates vm_disks records without requiring replication job
  - Database model updated: JobID field changed from string to *string (pointer for NULL support)
  - Replication workflow updated to use existing vm_disks records (not re-create)
  - Added disk_id column to backup_jobs table for proper multi-disk backup tracking
  - **Impact**: Backup operations now have immediate access to disk metadata
  - **Testing**: pgtest1 discovered with 2 disks (102GB + 5GB) successfully populated with job_id=NULL
  - Binary: sendense-hub-v2.11.1-vm-disks-null-fix deployed
  - Related issue: Phase 1 VMware Backups required disk metadata but discovery didn't store it
  - Solution: Stop throwing away disk information from VMA discovery, store immediately
  
- **Repository Creation Success Field Missing** (October 6, 2025):
  - Frontend was checking `data.success` but backend returned bare repository object
  - Backend now returns `{ success: true, repository: {...} }` format for POST /api/v1/repositories
  - Modal now closes properly after successful repository creation
  - Success alert displays correctly: "Repository 'xxx' created successfully!"
  - Binary: sendense-hub-v2.10.4-repo-create-success-field deployed to dev and preprod
  
### Fixed
- **Repository GUI Storage Display and Modal UX** (October 6, 2025):
  - Fixed storage_info field name mismatch in frontend (was checking `storage`, should be `storage_info`)
  - Repository capacities now display correctly (491GB instead of 0GB)
  - Modal now closes immediately after successful repository creation
  - Added success alert notification after repository creation
  - Improved user feedback for repository operations
  
- **Repository API JSON Error Handling** (October 6, 2025):
  - Fixed all repository API endpoints to return proper JSON error responses
  - Changed `http.Error()` plain text responses to `{ success: false, error: "message" }` format
  - Fixed frontend "Unexpected token" errors caused by trying to parse plain text as JSON
  - Applied to `CreateRepository`, `DeleteRepository`, and validation errors
  - Binary: sendense-hub-v2.10.3-repo-refresh-delete-fix deployed
  
- **Repository API Response Format** (October 6, 2025):
  - Fixed ListRepositories handler to return `{ success: true, repositories: [] }` format
  - Backend was returning bare array `[]`, frontend expected wrapped object

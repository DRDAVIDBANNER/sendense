## ✅ **DEPLOYMENT RESULTS**

### **Migration Status**

**Migration**: `20251003160000_add_operation_summary.up.sql`  
**Status**: ✅ **APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY**

```sql
-- Column added:
ALTER TABLE vm_replication_contexts
ADD COLUMN last_operation_summary JSON NULL;
```

**Verification**:
```
✅ Migration applied
✅ Deployment complete
```

### **Service Status**

**Service**: oma-api.service  
**Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE AND RUNNING**

```
Active: active (running) since Fri 2025-10-03 17:41:16 BST
Memory: 16.1M (peak: 16.6M)
CPU: 36ms
Tasks: 9
```

**Health Check**:
```json
{
  "database": "connected",
  "service": "OMA API",
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T16:41:27Z",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### **Job Recovery System**

**Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL**

**Startup Logs**:
```
🔍 Initializing intelligent job recovery system with VMA validation
🚀 Running intelligent job recovery scan with VMA validation...
🔍 Starting intelligent job recovery with VMA validation on OMA startup
📊 Found 0 active jobs in states: [replicating initializing ...]
✅ No active jobs found - system is clean
✅ Job recovery completed successfully
```

**Analysis**: No active jobs on this server at deployment time, which is expected. Job recovery system initialized correctly and will activate when jobs are present.

---

### **Failover Visibility Enhancement**

**Status**: ✅ **READY**

**Features Deployed**:
- ✅ Error sanitization module loaded
- ✅ Step name mapping active
- ✅ Operation summary storage ready
- ✅ Database schema updated

**Database Verification**:
```sql
-- New column confirmed present
Table: vm_replication_contexts
Column: last_operation_summary
Type: longtext (JSON)
Status: Ready for use
```

## 📋 **NEXT ACTIONS**

1. **Monitor for 24 hours** - Ensure stability
2. **Test with active jobs** - Verify job recovery works when jobs present
3. **Test failover operation** - Verify error sanitization works
4. **Compare with .147** - Both servers should behave identically
